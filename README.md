# Englympics-Programming-Team---Wildfire-Game
This project implements an AI agent responsible for controlling a firefighter robot in a real-time simulation. The robot must avoid spreading fires, extinguish flames efficiently, and collect strategic power-ups such as rapid fire, super bullets, and rapid movement boosts.
The challenge included limited decision time per game tick, dynamic enemy behavior, and balancing offense vs. evasion.

My Contributions

Designed one of the team’s core strategies using if-else based decision logic to determine when to attack fires versus when to collect power-ups.

Ran iterative simulations and documented performance metrics to compare strategy effectiveness.

Improved logic for movement, targeting, and survival consistency.

Contributed to the project presentation and delivered a major portion of the explanation.

Outcome

Our team finished 2nd among three competing teams with an average score of 847 ticks across evaluation rounds.
